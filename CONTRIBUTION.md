# Contributing Guide - Embedding Evacuation Routes

## Code of Conduct
Be constructive in critique of people's work.
If something seems like it could break large portions of the project, DO NOT SUBMIT!
Assume good faith in all contributions.
## Getting Started

The game is built in Unity. Unity should be installed and working on the contributor's system.
Ensure you have a working Unity to Github pipeline- this is vital for being able to submit.
Clone the repo, and start your work in the downloaded unity project.
List prerequisites, setup steps, environment variables/secrets handling, and how to run the app locally.

## Branching & Workflow

Each group member should have their own branch, and should not be working on main.
Branches should be named on the group member. A brief descriptior of what the branch's job is should also be present.

Branches should only be pushed to main when the group has agreed to do so.
## Issues & Planning

If a serious issue or game-breaking bug has been found, raise it with the usage of github issues.
If it is espcially serious, share it in the group's Discord.
Explain how to file issues, required templates/labels, estimation, and triage/assignment practices.
## Commit Messages
State the most meaninguful and direct contributuions, the ones that you are doing this commit for.
State any shortcomings or issues you think should be of note. Do not push "hacky code" without saying it is of such.
EX: -added trees, improved generation algorithm
EX: - implemented fire mechanics, needs work


## Code Style, Linting & Formatting

It's a project done primarily in Unity and C#, there shouldn't be any major format concerns.

## Testing

Testing should be done by the contributor. It's okay however if the team finds a issue after push.
Tests are mandatory for all contributions and commits.
## Pull Requests & Reviews

Pull requests should be not only reviewed on Github, but discussed in our team member's discord. Even if it's something everyone is on board with, a PR should be given time to be reviewed properly.

If a member disagrees, they should be able to provide reasoning on why they are as such.

## CI/CD
Below is the charter document.

## Security & Secrets

There isn't really a instance in which security is a issue in our project, but we should be sure to leave out any personal info in our commits. 
## Documentation Expectations

README should be updated in the event a major change or modification to the program is made.
Add a more detailed version of your commit message in the CHANGELOG doc, with bullets for each addition.

## Release Process

1.X should be for MAJOR additons and changes.
1.0.X should be for minor changes and bug fixes.
Do not go to 2.0!

## Support & Contact

Contact other team members for any help or questions we may have. Discord is most preferable.
